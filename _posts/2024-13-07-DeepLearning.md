## Abstract

<div style="text-align: justify; font-style: italic;">
As I recently went through a journey of learning how to make use of deep learning (in the context of computer graphics), I thought it would be good to write down some notes to help others get up to speed quickly. The goal of this article is to make the reader familiar with terms and concepts used in deep learning and to implement a basic deep learning algorithm. This should make it easier to study and understand other deep learning resources.
